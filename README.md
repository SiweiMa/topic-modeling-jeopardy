# Topic modeling for Jeopardy! questions

*Jeopardy!* is a game show in which contestants compete to answer questions the fastest against one another. Questions are placed on a game board under themes and monetary value. In this project, This identify and classify the topcs of Jeopardy! question by topic modeling methods, including Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and word embedding with k-means clustering. By comparing these methods, we found that word embedding with k-means clustering performs better than the other two method. Then the trend of the topics over years was plotted according to word embedding with k-means clustering method.
